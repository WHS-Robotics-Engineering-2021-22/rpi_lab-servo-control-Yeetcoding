1. In what various ways does the servo behave differently than a DC motor?
  It is much more accuate, but usually it does not rotate 360 degrees. It also requires different code, as you only need to apply voltage and current to the 
  DC motor in order for it to move, whereas a Servo requires controlled signals. 

2. What makes the use of a servo more complex (remember that if you were controlling a DC motor with a Pi, you would need to write some code)?
  It requires specific signals instead of just on or off. 

3. What applications do you think servos are appropriate for? Explain.
  If you need something to be done accurately. I think one of my favorite application of a servo motor that I have seen was to move a weight. Basically, this 
  servo moved a weight inside a bowling ball, which then made the bowling ball curve in a desired direction. A servo was used because it wasn't moving anything
  or connected to a wheel, but rather a weight on a lever. The accuracy of the servo allowed for the creator to accuately move the bowling ball.
